Intro: 
Our scenario (mini world) is the NBA. Our mini world describes the relationship between players, their teams, and player stats. 

Requirements Analysis:
Our data will be pulled from the publically available 2022-2023 regular season NBA player stats. 
NBA players each have a position, player ID, age, name, field goal percentage, 3 pointer percentage, minutes played and points per game. 
NBA teams each have a win count, loss count, name, conference, color, home city, and abbreviation. 
The relationship between players and teams, Plays_On, denotes the number of years any given player has played for any given team. 

Constraints:
Team abbreviation must be 3 letter string 
Win count, loss count, age, and minutes are integers
Position must be a string from the array: [C,PF,SF,SG,PG]
Points per game (PPG), field goal percentage(FG%) and 3 point percentage(3P%) must be floats 
No numeric value can be negative 
Any abbreviation + player ID combination must be unique 
PID is also unique

Operations:
Best scorer overall by team and position 
Best player by position per team 
Player ranking by position within age bracket independent of team 
Minutes played per position ranked descendingly per team 
Team wins ordered by player PPG 
All players by team color 
 
Relational Schema (Normalized):
[* star * denotes primary keys]

Team(*abrv*, name)
Team_info(*abrv*,wins,loss,conf,city,color)
Plays_for(*abrv*,*PID*,years)
Player(*PID*,position,PPG,FG%,3P%,name,age,minutes)
